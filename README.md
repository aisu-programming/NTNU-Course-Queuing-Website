## Tutorial of network management ([Reverse proxy](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%8D%E5%90%91%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86))

I used Apache at the beginning, but it is extremely slow.

Then I tried Nginx, but it seems like containing a lot of bugs on Windows, it is not friendly...

In the end, I tried Caddy... And I found that it is super fast and easy to configure. Amazing!

1. Apply for certificates to change HTTP to HTTPS

   1. You can use [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/zh-tw/) to generate your certificates.
   
      There are plenty tutorials on the Internet, I list the best one for me at here only:
      - https://blog.miniasp.com/post/2021/02/11/Create-SSL-TLS-certificates-from-LetsEncrypt-using-Certbot

   2. Move the certificates that you generated by Certbot into directory `Proxy`.
   
2. Buy a domain

   I bought one on NameCheap with about 2 USD (about 60 TWD), which is "ntnu.site".

3. Caddy (Reverse proxy)

   1. Download [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases/download/v2.4.6/caddy_2.4.6_windows_amd64.zip).
   2. You can choose to add its path into environment variables, or put the whole directory here.

      I'm not going to explain this in detail because it is tedious and a little complicated.

      Here's a tutorial for you guys: https://wst24365888.github.io/install-caddy/
   3. Rename `Caddyfile_example` in directory `Proxy` to `Caddyfile`.
   4. Open it and do some changes:

      1. Change "YOUR_DOMAIN" in line 1 to your domain.
      2. Change "FULL_CHAIN.PEM" in line 3 to your full chain certificate filename. Default should be "fullchain1.pem".
      3. Change "PRIVATE_KEY.PEM" in line 3 to your private key certificate filename. Default should be "privkey1.pem".
      4. Change "BACK_END_URL" to your Back-End URL.

         Most of the people setup Back-End on the same computer with reverse proxy, then the Back-End URL should be "127.0.0.1".
      5. Do same thing to "FRONT_END_URL"
      6. Change "BACK_END_PORT" to your Back-End port. Default should be 5000.
      7. Change "FRONT_END_PORT" to your Front-End port. Default should be 3000.

   5. Run the Caddy with command `caddy run` or `caddy start`.
